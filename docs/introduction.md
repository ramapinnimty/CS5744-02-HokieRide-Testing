**Project Title:** Test Plan for RideVT

**Authors:** Aparna Ganesh, Mayur Dhepe, Purna Srivatsa, Rama Krishna Pinnimty

The system for which this test document is written for is the ride-sharing system called RideVT. It is aimed towards being a beneficial and efficient system for Virginia Tech students who need assistance for transportation purposes. RideVT has been designed to transport one or multiple passengers to locations they desire and be a cost-efficient choice for students by sharing their rides with others. The following pages will document how the system will be tested, along with its individual system modules, through a series of integration and validation tests.
